# Work and research

I currently work on distributed systems at Google.

Before that, I completed a Ph.D. in 2020 in the Paul G. Allen School of
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I was
advised by [Irene Zhang](https://irenezhang.net),
[Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind),
and [Hank Levy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/levy). I received
my B.S. in Computer Science in 2014 from Duke University, where I was advised
by [Pankaj K. Agarwal](https://www.cs.duke.edu/~pankaj/) and
[Thomas M&oslash;lhave](http://moelhave.dk/).

My research interests in grad school were in operating systems and distributed
systems. My projects included
[Hercules](https://irenezhang.net/papers/hercules-tr19.pdf), a distributed
storage system for real-time interactive apps, and
[Marvin](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/lebeck), an
improved memory manager for Android that performs swapping in the Java runtime.
I started in the Systems Lab working on
[Diamond](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/zhang-irene),
a wide-area distributed data management system.

Before joining the Systems Lab at UW, I worked in robotics, geographic
information systems (GIS), and computational biology.

# Fun

I wrote an app called [CouchPotato](https://github.com/nlebeck/CouchPotato)
that lets you browse streaming video websites on a PC using an Xbox controller.

I wrote a website that [randomly generates Bruce Springsteen song
titles](https://nlebeck.github.io/springsteen-song-title-generator/springsteen.html).

My talk on [Existential Consistency](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kEcpuYx6AFFd8P_wXuuxuKlQyjAcgwl7FMbQjH4lu6Q/edit?usp=sharing)
won Best Paper at UW CSE's first annual, completely serious "Workshop on Hot
Topics in Potentially Computer Science" (HotPoCSci 2016).
